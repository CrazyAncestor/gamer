4. [ ] New features in GAMER
   1. [x] More flexible runtime parameter file
   2. [ ] Test problem infrastructure
   3. [ ] Revise the Makefile
      1. [x] Compile for all CUDA compute capabilities compatible with a
             given GPU_ARCH
      2. [ ] Put all system-dependent flags (e.g. XXX_PATH, CXXFLAG,...) to
             a separate makefile
      3. [ ] How to let hg ignore the change in the adopted makefile options?
   4. [ ] Add the option "BITWISE_REPRODUCIBILITY" (currently it's supported
          only in the debug mode)
   5. [ ] Grackle
   6. [ ] Optimize the particle-weighted load-balance scheme

# Things should be done soon after the release
#==================================================
1. [ ] Integrate MHD
2. [ ] Support resolutions beyond 2^24 (which needs the 128-bit Hilbert curve)
3. [ ] Support smoothing the particle density field above a given AMR level
       (useful for both the merging cluster and first star simulations)
