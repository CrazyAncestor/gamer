Compilation flags:
========================================
Enable : MODEL=ELBDM, GRAVITY, PARTICLE, SUPPORT_HDF5, SUPPORT_GSL
Disable: COMOVING, UNSPLIT_GRAVITY, CONSERVE_MASS, LAPLACIAN_4TH


Default setup:
========================================


Note:
========================================
1. You can put many clouds particles in ELBDM mode, and observe their evolution through gravity.
   To assign the number of clouds, input the desired number in variable "NFW_num" in "Init_TestProb_ELBDM_NFW.cpp".
   And please input the file names of test problem parameters in "string TestProb_FileName[NFW_num]" for each cloud respectively.
2. Test the evolution of NFW model
   To switch among the types of models, find variable "string TypeNames[NFW_num]" and edit it in "Init_TestProb_ELBDM_NFW.cpp".
   Available options include:
   Plummer
   NFW
   Burkert
   Jaffe
   Hernquist
   Einasto
   UNKNOWN
   If you want to initialize a model with some given density profile in the form of a table, please use option "UNKNOWN",and input
      your file names in "string Profile_FileName[NFW_num]"; otherwise input "NONE" in it.
3. Sometimes the spatial resolution is not small enough for some models like Jaffe, please increase MAX_LEVEL in "Input_Parameter"
4. You can utitilize the tools in the directory "plot_profile".
   To use it, simply type command:
   sh plot.sh initial_time_data_file(like Data_000000) final_time_data_file density_profile_name.png
