   ** HYDRO caustic test **
   ************************

Procedure to run the test problem:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Execute the script "Copy.sh" to copy files to their corresponding
   directories

2. Compile GAMER by typing "make" in the directory "GAMER/src"
   ("make clean" first if the program has been compiled previously)

3. Run GAMER by executing the file "Dizzy" in the directory "GAMER/bin/Run"


Note:

2. This test is good for testing the dual-energy formalism
   --> Without it the preshock region will be over-heated
